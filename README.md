# My Scripts

This repo contains all the - non-private - useful scripts that I've wrote. Each subfolder contains its own README, which explains how to use the script(s).


## Noteworthy Scripts
### [OpenWrt](openwrt/#build-all-targets-build-all-targetssh): build for multiple targets
This script automates the compliation of many OpenWrt build targets. It dynamically adjusts from 1 to many build enviroments. No hardcoded strings necessary.
